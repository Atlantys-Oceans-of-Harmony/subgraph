# Atlantys Subgraph

## Built on top of HORIZON BRIDGE SUBGRAPH

- https://github.com/harmony-one/horizon-bridge-subgraph

## Prerequisites

- Run graph node locally using `docker-compore up` or point to `https://graph.t.hmny.io:8020/` as described in [docs.harmony.one](https://docs.harmony.one/home/developers/tools/the-graph)
- `yarn codegen`
- `yarn build`
- `yarn create-local` or `npm run create-local`
- `yarn deploy-local` or `npm run deploy-local`

This subgraph dynamically tracks assets and events

- aggregated data across managers, assets and wallets
- data on individual assets
- data on transactions
- data on managers
- data on wallets

## Queries

Below are a few ways to show how to query the horizon-bridge-subgraph for data. The queries show most of the information that is queryable, but there are many other filtering options that can be used, just check out the [querying api](https://thegraph.com/docs/graphql-api). These queries can be used locally or in The Graph Explorer playground.
